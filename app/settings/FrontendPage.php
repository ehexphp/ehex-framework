    public $tokenization = "<p>
                            Real estate tokenization is a process that involves representing ownership or investment in real estate assets using blockchain technology and digital tokens. In traditional real estate, ownership is typically divided into shares, and these shares are held by individual investors or entities. Tokenization takes this concept a step further by digitizing these ownership shares and representing them as tokens on a blockchain.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Here's how real estate tokenization works:
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Asset Selection: A real estate property, whether it's a residential, commercial, or industrial property, is selected for tokenization.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Legal and Regulatory Compliance: The property undergoes legal and regulatory scrutiny to ensure that it can be tokenized according to the relevant laws and regulations in the jurisdiction.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Creation of Tokens: The ownership shares of the property are divided into digital tokens, with each token representing a fractional ownership in the property. For instance, if a property is divided into 100 tokens, owning one token might represent 1% ownership of the property.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Blockchain Implementation: The digital tokens are then issued and managed on a blockchain platform. The blockchain provides a transparent, immutable, and secure ledger to track ownership and transactions.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Investment Opportunities: Investors can purchase these tokens, allowing them to invest in real estate without having to buy an entire property. This democratizes real estate investing by reducing the barrier to entry.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Liquidity and Trading: One of the significant advantages of tokenization is increased liquidity. Traditional real estate investments can be illiquid, as selling a physical property can take time. However, tokenized real estate allows for easier and faster trading of ownership tokens on secondary markets, providing investors with more flexibility.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Transparency: Blockchain technology ensures transparency by providing a secure and publicly accessible record of ownership transfers, transactions, and historical data related to the property.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Dividends and Returns: Rental income or profits generated from the property can be distributed to token holders in proportion to their ownership. This can be automated through smart contracts.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Global Accessibility: Real estate tokenization can attract investors from around the world, as it eliminates geographical barriers and allows for cross-border investments.
                        </p>";
